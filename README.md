# TMDb Movies EDA
This project investigates and performs EDA and some data wrangling on a dataset containing information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb). This data set is found on [Kagle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata). The dataset was modified by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). The goal of this project is to explore the factors that influence the popularity of movies and identify the genres with the highest revenue.
